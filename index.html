            <h2> My Title </h2>
            <div class="text-container">
                <p> Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building. </p>
                <p>Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed. </p>
                <p>Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: Cameron Offices, National Gallery of Australia and High Court of Australia. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture"> Brutalist </a> architecture is the best </p>


                <h3> Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia </h3>
                <h4> History </h4>
                <p> Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. The Trust began consideration of erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968. In 1969 it acquired a lease for land on Northbourne Avenue, the current site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd to design the building.
                </p>
                <p>The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in addition was to provide rental office accommodation for commercial tenants as a means of generating income for the Trust. Features of the original design included:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the current north wing, which housed a display on the work of the Trust; </li>
                    <li>the flat roof area of the east and south wings which was intended to be a roof terrace; and </li>
                    <li> Accommodation in the building included a board room, dining room, reception area, bar and kitchen. </li>
                </ul>
