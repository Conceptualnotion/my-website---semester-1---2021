            <h2>Canberra Buildings </h2>
            <div class="text-container">

                <p> Churchill House is one of a number of Canberra buildings designed in the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style. These include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>National Gallery of Australia, 1971; </li>
                    <li>Cameron Offices, 1976; </li>
                    <li> Canberra School of Music, 1976; and </li>
                    <li>High Court of Australia, 1980. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> Churchill House is an early example in this context, and one of only two examples of an office building. While Brutalism has been described as an ethic rather than an aesthetic (Banham 1966:10), both office buildings display a more restrained form compared to the other buildings, several of which were intended to portray a distinctive image in the national capital.</p>

                <p>He is also credited with the following designs in the ACT:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dr Hilary Roche House, Bedford Street, Deakin (1954); </li>
                    <li>Zoology building ANU (1961); </li>
                    <li> Three houses in Vasey Crescent, Campbell (1961) (Grounds & Boyd); </li>
                    <li> W G Verge House, 204 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill (1963); </li>
                    <li> 204 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill (1964); and </li>
                    <li> Zoology Building ANU (1963-8). </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Residential Designs
                </h3>
                <p>His architectural work is mostly known through his residential designs. He was known for his ability to design houses that would meet client needs, solve site problems and still retain architectural integrity. The designs were heavily influenced by the functional and international styles of architecture and became known as the Melbourne Regional style. It was light, simple and elegant and unmistakably modern. (Architecture Today 1972; Saunders 1972; and Serle 1995)
                </p>
                <p>Boyd’s residential designs that are registered on the ACT Heritage Register include:

                    <li> Fenner House, 8 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill (1953); and </li>
                    <li> Eltringham House, 12 Marawa Place, Aranda (1968-69). </li>
